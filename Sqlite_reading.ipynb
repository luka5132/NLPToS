By visiting this website you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree please do not use or access our Site or products. \\n\\nThis Privacy Policy describes the information, as part of the normal operation of our services, we collect from you and what may happen to that information. Although this policy may seem long, we have prepared a detailed policy because we believe you should know as much as possible about DocuSign\\'s practices so that you can make informed decisions. \\n\\nBy accepting the Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in registration, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the DocuSign Terms of Use Agreement. This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance in registration for new registering users, and is otherwise effective on November 24th, 2003 for all users. \\n\\n1\\\\. Information We Collect.\\n\\nOur primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, secure online application which will assist you in sending and signing contracts. In order to do so, DocuSign must collect information to identify users, and to allow our users to identify each other.\\xa0 We only collect information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose. \\n\\nIn general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to use our services, we may require you to provide contact and identity information, billing information, shipping information and other personal information as indicated on the forms throughout the Site. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature. \\n\\nUnder some circumstances or users may require some additional information in order to authenticate you such as, but not limited to: your name, your address, or the last 4 digits of your social security number. We may also use financial information, including credit card information to verify the accuracy of your name, address, and other information, as well as to bill you for your use of our services.\\xa0 Under no circumstances will any of this information be used to generate a credit scoring report that will show up against your credit.\\n\\nWe automatically track certain information to increase security such as IP addresses, email addresses, and other information.\\n\\nWe may use data collection devices such as \"cookies\" on certain pages of the Site to help analyze our web page flow, measure effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. \"Cookies\" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a \"cookie\". We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are \"session cookies,\" meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Site and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session. \\n\\nAdditionally, the DocuSign Express™ client is loaded on your computer if you wish to send documents for signature.\\xa0 This client is also governed by this Privacy policy.\\n\\nIf you establish a credit account with us to pay the fees we charge, we collect some additional information, such as a billing address, a credit card number and a credit card expiration date and tracking information from checks or money orders. \\n\\nIf you use DocuSign to send documents we will encrypt and store these documents in an account and make the contents available only to those whom you invite to view or sign these files.\\xa0 DocuSign employees do not have access to this information, nor can they access your signature file or other data, but it is stored in our system.\\n\\nIf you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. \\n\\nIf you register for DocuSign on another web site or use a web site providing a service for DocuSign or a web site that helps facilitate your activity on DocuSign, that web site may provide personal information about you and your transactions back to DocuSign. \\n\\n2\\\\. Our Use of Your Information.\\n\\nWe use your personal information to facilitate the services you request. We use your personal information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site to: resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; help promote safe exchange of documents for signature and delivery; collect fees owed; authenticate users, inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our User Agreement; and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular we may examine your personal information to identify users using multiple User IDs or aliases. We may compare and review your personal information for errors, omissions and for accuracy. \\n\\nIf you choose to use our service and pay with credit card or corporate invoice, we use your address and billing information to bill you and provide associated support. \\n\\n3\\\\. Our Disclosure of Your Information.\\n\\nAs a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services. \\n\\nWe may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product and service operations that we provide to you (e.g., search technology, authentication systems, bill collection, and fraud detection) and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers. These internal service providers\\' are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced DocuSign related operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nDocuSign cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you and the DocuSign community from bad actors. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email address, UserID history, fraud complaints, usage history without a subpoena. Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to: prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email, and company name to DocuSign Internal Service Providers under confidentiality agreement, as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. \\n\\nDue to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private, but you should know that we will take all reasonable steps to provide you a highly secure environment. \\n\\n4\\\\. Your Use of Other Users\\' Information.\\n\\nIn order to facilitate interaction among all DocuSign Express™ members, our Product may allow you limited access other users\\' contact and authentication status information. \\n\\nBy entering into our User Agreement, you agree that, with respect to other users\\' information that you obtain through the Site or through an DocuSign-related communication or DocuSign-facilitated transaction, DocuSign hereby grants to you a license to use such information only for: (a) DocuSign-related communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages, (b) using services offered through DocuSign (e.g. document sending, signing, notarizing, etc), and (c) any other purpose that a user expressly agrees to after you tell them the purpose you would like to use it for. In all cases, you must give users an opportunity to withdraw consent to sign electronically. In addition, under no circumstances, except as defined in this Section, can you disclose personal information about another user to any third party without our consent and the consent of that user. You agree that other users may use your personal information to communicate with you in accordance with this Section.\\n\\nDocuSign and our users do not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you are not licensed to send any message to another DocuSign user, (email or physical mail) without their express consent. To report DocuSign related spam to DocuSign, please contact us at info@docusign.com. \\n\\n5\\\\. Control of Your Password.\\n\\nYou are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password, including fees charged to your account, and all actions taken with your account. Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your DocuSign password to any third parties. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.\\n\\n6\\\\. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information.\\n\\nWe offer you the ability to automatically review and change the information you submit to us by logging into the Site and entering in the new information yourself. Generally, we will not modify your personal information based on your request because it is difficult to authenticate your account manually. You can change your password, contact information, financial information, and user preferences by going the profile area. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Changing your personal information will not impact any completed transactions.\\n\\nUpon your request, we will deactivate your account, contact information, billing information, shipping information, and financial information from our active databases. To make this request, email  sales@DocuSign.com. Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible based on your account activity and in accordance with our deactivation policy and applicable law.\\xa0\\n\\nWe will retain in our files some personal information, and past document transactions to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our User Agreement and comply with legal requirements as is permitted by law. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. However, such personal information will be deactivated from member viewing and will only be available to select DocuSign personal. \\n\\n7\\\\. Other Information Collectors.\\n\\nExcept as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties using our system, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Since DocuSign does not control the privacy policies of third parties, or other individuals actions, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third party or individuals. We encourage you to be sure the recipients are authenticated to your satisfaction before you send them any documents.\\n\\n8\\\\. Security.\\n\\nYour information is stored on DocuSign Inc.\\'s servers located in the United States. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption, \"firewalls\" and Secure Socket Layers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, \"perfect security\" does not exist on the Internet. \\n\\n9\\\\. Notice.\\n\\nWe may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amend terms on the Site. All amended terms shall automatically be effective 30 days after they are initially posted on the Site. In addition, we will notify you in accordance with the law.   \\n\\xa0\\n',\n",

Online Analytics and Tailored Online Advertising\\n\\nOnline Analytics.\\n\\nWe may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics and Mixpanel.\\xa0 These providers use cookie-related technologies (described in the “Information that is Collected Automatically” section above) to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive.\\xa0 The information collected will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services.\\xa0 To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser\\xa0 by clicking here, and you may also use Mixpanel’s opt out by clicking here.\\n\\nTailored Online Advertising.\\n\\nThird parties whose products or services are accessible or marketed via the Services may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer or other device to collect information about your use of the Services, in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve advertising content based on past visits to our Services and other sites and (ii) report how our advertising content impressions, other uses of advertising services, and interactions with these advertising impressions and services are related to visits to our Services.\\xa0We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, AdRoll, and AppNexus, and others) to serve tailored advertising to you on the Services, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer or other device you use to access the Services. We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed by such third parties.\\n\\nIf you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer or mobile browser to deliver tailored advertising (i.e., not just for the Services), you may visit the following pages/sites to learn more and opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.\\n\\n  * Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out Link\\n  * Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out Link\\n  * TRUSTe’s Advertising Choices\\n\\n\\n\\nTo opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page.\\n\\nPlease note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertising content even if you opt-out of tailored advertising.\\xa0 In that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests.\\xa0 Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.\\n\\nWhen accessing the Services from a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system: iOS, Android and Windows Phone provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements. \\xa0For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or operating system or contact the applicable platform operator.\\n\\nCalifornia Do Not Track Disclosure. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Services for third party purposes, and that is why we provide above the NAI “Consumer Opt-out” link, DAA opt-out link, TRUSTe opt-out link, and Google opt-out link.\\xa0 However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions.\\n\\n### 5\\\\.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as necessary for legitimate business purposes.\\n\\nReviewing and Updating Your Account.

Email and Direct Marketing Choices.\\n\\nWe provide opt-out information in all commercial email messages we send via an “unsubscribe” link.\\xa0 We reserve the right to send one message confirming your opt-out from a messaging program.\\xa0 Please note that it may take us some time to process your requests consistent with applicable law. \\xa0You do not have the ability to opt-out of transactional or relationship messages (e.g., signing notifications or account notifications) that we send if you are a registered user of our Services or if you have engaged in transactions with us.\\xa0 To opt out of other direct marketing from us, please contact us using the email below in Section 13.\\n\\n### 7\\\\. How We Protect Your Information\\n\\nWe employ physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access to your information. We choose these safeguards based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.\\xa0 Although we take measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, the Internet and the Services are not 100% secure so we cannot assure you that information we collect or store will be protected from all unauthorized access and thereby used in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.\\xa0\\n\\n### 8\\\\.
